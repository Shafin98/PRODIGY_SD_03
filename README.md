This project consist of a web application for A Simple Contact management System to store user name, email & phone number, which I created using Electron framework. 
First download all the files, then in the terminal type "npm i" to initilize NodeModule. 
Next, type "npm i electron --save-dev" to install electron as development dependency. 
To run the app enter the command "npm run electron".
